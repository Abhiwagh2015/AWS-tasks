Instead of using NAT Gateway use ec2 instance?**** ----> we have to create Nat instance
 
create vpc --> attach IGW
create public and private subnets 
create route table for public and private 
launch instance with NAT ami ---> Community AMI--> aws_nat Ami {using public subnet }
launch instance using private subnet 
Attach IGW and associate public subnet in public route table
Attach nat instance --> instances --> select nat instance and associate private subnet 
take ssh of nat instance and fron that take private instance take ssh of private instance and ping it
